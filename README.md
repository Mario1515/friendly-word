# Friendly World -> Fundraising platform

## About The Project - Non-technical Description

This project is an Animal Rescue Web Application built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Handlebars. It allows users to register, login, and manage animal rescue posts with functionalities like creating, viewing, editing, deleting, and donating to posts. The application features authentication and authorization using JWT, secure password handling with bcrypt, and dynamic content rendering with Handlebars.

### Project Vision:

The Animal Rescue Web Application is a fundraising project created by me to support animal rescue efforts. The vision behind this project is to provide a platform where users can easily create and manage rescue posts, raise funds, and facilitate the adoption of animals in need.
